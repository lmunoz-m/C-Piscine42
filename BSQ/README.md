# **BSQ**

The "BSQ" project is a program that finds the largest possible square on a given map while avoiding obstacles. The program takes in a file that contains a map, where the first line specifies the number of rows, the "empty" character, the "obstacle" character, and the "full" character. The map is made up of rows of "empty" and "obstacle" characters, and the objective of the program is to replace the "empty" characters with "full" characters to represent the largest possible square. If there are multiple solutions, the program chooses the square in the top-left corner. The map must be valid, meaning all rows have the same length, there is at least one row with at least one character, and each row ends with a newline character. If the map is invalid, the program outputs "map error" followed by a newline character and moves on to the next map.

For example, if given the following map:

```bash
9.ox
...........................
....o......................
............o..............
...........................
....o......................
...............o...........
...........................
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................
```

The program should output the following map with the largest square marked by 'x' characters:



```bash
.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxxo..............
.....xxxxxxx...............
....oxxxxxxx...............
.....xxxxxxx...o...........
.....xxxxxxx...............
......o..............o.....
..o.......o................
```
